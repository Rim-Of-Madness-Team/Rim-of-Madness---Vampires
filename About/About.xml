  <description>1.28.0.2 (11-25-2022)

Adds vampires to RimWorld.

Heavily inspired by Vampire the Masquerade, this mod introduces a disease known as vampirism.
There are five Vampire bloodlines included with the mod currently.
Different bloodlines have different abilities: over 50!
Adds in "vitae" and blood mechanics (check the needs menu).

REQUIRES JECSTOOLS TO PLAY
		
Avilable languages: English, Spanish (by Daru), and Russian (by kr33man)
